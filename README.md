# Sorting Algorithms

## Learning Objectives
* Describe how a Bubble Sort is performed and its time complexity
* Implement a sorting algorithm in ruby
* Offer a solution to optimize the algorithm

A bubblesort is performed by taking the first two index  of an array and comparing it to the next one and sorting them if necessary then moving on to the next inex and repeating until the ntire array is sorted.


## To do

* Run the `rspec` command in the root directory of this project.

* Use our pseudo code in class to try to get the tests to pass

## Hint
* Check the [pseudo code listed on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort). Make sure you understand how it works.
